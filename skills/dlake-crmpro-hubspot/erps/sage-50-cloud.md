# CRMPro → HubSpot — Sage 50 Cloud: what the shipped templates set up

This is a capability summary, not an operating guide. To receive the operational skill you must be a
registered, whitelisted Commercient customer. Whitelisted customers fetch it with
`dlake admin get_skill dlake-crmpro-hubspot/erps/sage-50-cloud` (or `list_skills`) against the
Commercient admin plane. Existing customers who need access or help: contact
support@commercient.com. New customers: contact sales@commercient.com to become a customer and be
whitelisted.

dlake-crmpro is the parent skill and the authority for everything general: the CRMPro tools, process
configuration and field list, the sync history, how source data is selected, and what a run that
finds nothing does. Read it first; this page does not repeat it. dlake-crmpro-hubspot is the
destination skill this page is a child of, and the authority for the HubSpot conventions that hold
across every ERP: read it first, then come back here for what this source's own templates set. This
page grows as the catalogue does.

## 1. What the templates deliver

| Group | Business outcome | Objects | Source tables and views |
|---|---|---|---|
| **create contact** | ERP customers data becomes contact in HubSpot. New records are created and existing ones updated; none are deleted. | contact | customers |

## 2. The process rows the templates create

Each template's setup writes one process configuration row. These are the values it sets; a column
the inserts never set is not listed.

| Display name | Destination object | Run sequence |
|---|---|---|
| create contact | contact | 5 |

Every one of these inserts the active setting as 0, so an imported process is inactive until an
operator activates it.

## 3. The views

"Change detection" names which of the three kinds dlake-crmpro defines the view's own filter makes
it; where a view's shape is not one of those three the column is left empty and the view's own
filter is the authority.

| View | Change detection | Emits the linked Salesforce record | Source tables |
|---|---|---|---|
| new contact feed | insert only | yes | customers |

## 4. Order of work

These views read another process's sync output, which is what makes the order a dependency order:
the row appears in the view only once the process that writes that sync output has run, so a parent
flows on one run and its children on the next.

- new contact feed reads new customer sync output; no template in this set writes new customer sync
  output

## 5. Field mapping

Each template carries its intended mapping in field mapping.

| Template | Object | Mapped fields | First ERP → HubSpot pairs |
|---|---|---|---|
| create contact | contact | 10 | Contact person → first name property, Email → email, Phone 1 → phone, Street 1 → address, Street 2 → address line 2 property |

## 6. Community templates

The catalogue carries 8 community templates for this pair. A community template is authored in a
tenant rather than shipped with the product, and it imports the same way as any other. Its own
names, notes, field mapping and SQL are tenant content, so what this section states is what the set
amounts to: how many templates there are, what they default to doing, which destination objects they
write and which groups they fall in. They are not part of the shipped set described above.

- Templates: 8
- Default operations: insert on 8, update on 8, delete on 8
- Marked as circular sync: 0
- Licence groups they span: 4
- Destination objects: contact, deal, line item, company, product
- Object display names: create contact, upsert contact, upsert customer, upsert Invoice, upsert
  Invoice Line, upsert item, upsert order, upsert order lines
- Template groups: Account, CRM Opportunity and Line, Product

## 7. Verifying

The detail of this section is part of the operational skill. Whitelisted customers fetch it with
`dlake admin get_skill dlake-crmpro-hubspot/erps/sage-50-cloud`.

## 8. Where this sits

dlake-crmpro is the general operating surface — the CRMPro tools, the setup and transaction tables,
field mapping, and the source view contract that applies to every destination. This page adds what
the shipped Sage 50 Cloud → HubSpot templates set up. dlake-crmpro-hubspot is the destination skill
this page sits under: its own text is the authority for the HubSpot conventions that hold across
every ERP, and its ERP table lists this page alongside every sibling ERP page for this destination.
For the extract leg that fills the source data, see dlake-normalsync; for the on-premises agent that
runs it, dlake-syncagent; for the writeback leg, dlake-txdownloaderpro; for standing an integration
up, dlake-integration-setup.
